Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to assess the credit risk for a lending company. The essential goal here is to develop a machine learning model, with a focus on the logistic regression model, to predict the likelihood of loans being healthy or high-risk. 

Accuracy refers to the average recall for each class; precision refers to a metric that conveys the accuracy of positive predictions; and, recall refers to the measuring of the proporton of actual positives correctly identified. For the healthy loan class where precision holds the value of 1.00, this means when the model determines a loan is a healthy loan, it is correct 100% of the time. Where the recall for this class is 0.99, the model correctly identifies 99.% of actual healthy loans. Similarly, for the high-risk loan class, precision of 0.85 means it is correct 85% of the time at predict a loan as high-risk. The model also crrectly identifies 91% of actual high-risk loans. 

Overall, these metrics suggest that the machine learning model is able to perform well in identifying healthy loans with high precision and recall. SImilarly, it has a good balance between precision and recall for high-risk loans. The model is effective in accounting for class imbalance and is able to provide a good assessment of its performance.
